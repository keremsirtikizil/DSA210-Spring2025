## **Project: Measuring the Impact of ChatGPT on Coding Productivity and Learning**

### **Overview**  
As AI-assisted coding becomes increasingly popular, many developers rely on tools like ChatGPT to accelerate their workflow. But does it truly enhance productivity and learning, or does it create dependency and reduce problem-solving skills? This project will track my personal coding activities—both with and without ChatGPT—to measure its impact on efficiency, creativity, and learning. By analyzing my workflow across different coding phases (designing, implementing, debugging), I aim to uncover whether ChatGPT is a game-changer or a crutch in software development.

### **Motivation**  
AI-powered coding tools have revolutionized the way developers approach problem-solving. However, a critical question remains: Are these tools genuinely making us better programmers, or are they making us overly dependent?

This project is driven by the need to understand ChatGPT’s role in my coding journey. Specifically, I aim to:

- **Quantify ChatGPT’s impact** on coding speed and efficiency.
- Analyze its effects on different coding phases—does it help more in **designing, implementing, or debugging**?
- Evaluate long-term learning effects—am I improving as a developer, or am I losing problem-solving skills?
  
By systematically tracking my coding habits, I hope to provide meaningful insights into how AI tools should be integrated into a developer’s workflow for maximum productivity without sacrificing learning.

Understanding these effects can provide insights into how AI tools should be integrated into a developer’s workflow for maximum benefit.

### **Data Sources**  
The data will be collected exclusively from my own activities, including:
- **ChatGPT usage logs**: Time and frequency of ChatGPT interactions.
- **Coding activity logs**: Time spent coding, categorized into:
  - **Designing** (planning, structuring code, algorithm design)
  - **Implementing** (writing and testing new code)
  - **Debugging** (fixing errors, optimizing performance)
- **Terminal & IDE usage logs**: Time spent in coding environments (VS Code, terminal, etc.).
- **Commit history from GitHub**: Tracking coding progress over time.
- **Self-reported difficulty ratings**: Logging how difficult tasks feel with and without ChatGPT.

### **Methodology**  
#### **Data Collection & Cleaning**
- Manually log ChatGPT usage and categorize coding sessions.
- Extract IDE usage data (if available) to track active coding time.
- Align collected data with timestamps to measure task efficiency.

#### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Compare total coding time with and without ChatGPT.
- Analyze ChatGPT’s impact on different coding phases.
- Visualize trends in ChatGPT reliance over time.

#### **Correlation & Statistical Analysis**  
- Conduct hypothesis tests (T-test, ANOVA) to determine statistically significant differences.
- Identify efficiency gains or losses in designing, implementing, and debugging.

#### **Insights & Interpretation**  
- Does ChatGPT improve or slow down coding efficiency?
- In which phases (designing, implementing, debugging) is ChatGPT most beneficial or detrimental?
- How does ChatGPT usage evolve over time?

### **Data Collection Plan**  
- **Manually record coding sessions daily**, tracking ChatGPT interactions.
- **Use IDE/terminal logs** to validate recorded data.
- **Track GitHub commits** to measure actual coding output.
- **Collect data over several weeks** to ensure meaningful analysis.
- **I will collect the data throughout March over my 3 CS-coded courses'(Operating Systems, Programming Languages, Mobile Application Development) take-home exams.**

### **Expected Outcomes**  
- A clear understanding of how ChatGPT impacts coding productivity.
- Identification of coding phases where ChatGPT is most useful or harmful.
- Insights into whether ChatGPT improves problem-solving skills or leads to over-reliance.

### **Project Timeline**  
- **March 10:** Submit project proposal on GitHub (README.md, data collection plan).  
- **March 11-25:** Data collection and preliminary analysis.  
- **March 26 - April 10:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and correlation analysis.  
- **April 11-25:** Advanced modeling and visualization.  
- **May 23:** Final insights and conclusions.  
- **May 30:** Final submission and report presentation.  

This project will provide valuable insights into AI-assisted coding and its long-term effects on productivity and learning.
