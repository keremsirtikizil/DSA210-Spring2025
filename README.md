## **Project: Measuring the Impact of ChatGPT on Coding Productivity and Learning**

### **Overview**  
This project aims to analyze how ChatGPT affects my coding productivity and learning process. By tracking my coding activities with and without ChatGPT, I will measure whether it enhances efficiency or leads to dependency. Additionally, I will analyze which stages of coding (designing, implementing, debugging) are most impacted by ChatGPT. 

### **Motivation**  
While AI-assisted coding is becoming more prevalent, its actual impact on productivity and learning remains unclear. This project seeks to:
- Determine whether ChatGPT improves or hinders my coding speed and efficiency.
- Analyze how ChatGPT affects different phases of coding: **designing, implementing, and debugging**.
- Identify any dependency trends over time.

Understanding these effects can provide insights into how AI tools should be integrated into a developer’s workflow for maximum benefit.

### **Data Sources**  
The data will be collected exclusively from my own activities, including:
- **ChatGPT usage logs**: Time and frequency of ChatGPT interactions.
- **Coding activity logs**: Time spent coding, categorized into:
  - **Designing** (planning, structuring code, algorithm design)
  - **Implementing** (writing and testing new code)
  - **Debugging** (fixing errors, optimizing performance)
- **Terminal & IDE usage logs**: Time spent in coding environments (VS Code, terminal, etc.).
- **Commit history from GitHub**: Tracking coding progress over time.
- **Self-reported difficulty ratings**: Logging how difficult tasks feel with and without ChatGPT.

### **Methodology**  
#### **Data Collection & Cleaning**
- Manually log ChatGPT usage and categorize coding sessions.
- Extract IDE usage data (if available) to track active coding time.
- Align collected data with timestamps to measure task efficiency.

#### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Compare total coding time with and without ChatGPT.
- Analyze ChatGPT’s impact on different coding phases.
- Visualize trends in ChatGPT reliance over time.

#### **Correlation & Statistical Analysis**  
- Conduct hypothesis tests (T-test, ANOVA) to determine statistically significant differences.
- Identify efficiency gains or losses in designing, implementing, and debugging.

#### **Insights & Interpretation**  
- Does ChatGPT improve or slow down coding efficiency?
- In which phases (designing, implementing, debugging) is ChatGPT most beneficial or detrimental?
- How does ChatGPT usage evolve over time?

### **Data Collection Plan**  
- **Manually record coding sessions daily**, tracking ChatGPT interactions.
- **Use IDE/terminal logs** to validate recorded data.
- **Track GitHub commits** to measure actual coding output.
- **Collect data over several weeks** to ensure meaningful analysis.
- **I will collect the data throughout March over my 3 CS-coded courses'(Operating Systems, Programming Languages, Mobile Application Development) take-home exams.**

### **Expected Outcomes**  
- A clear understanding of how ChatGPT impacts coding productivity.
- Identification of coding phases where ChatGPT is most useful or harmful.
- Insights into whether ChatGPT improves problem-solving skills or leads to over-reliance.

### **Project Timeline**  
- **March 10:** Submit project proposal on GitHub (README.md, data collection plan).  
- **March 11-25:** Data collection and preliminary analysis.  
- **March 26 - April 10:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and correlation analysis.  
- **April 11-25:** Advanced modeling and visualization.  
- **May 23:** Final insights and conclusions.  
- **May 30:** Final submission and report presentation.  

This project will provide valuable insights into AI-assisted coding and its long-term effects on productivity and learning.
